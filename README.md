#SPEED DETECTOR

#Description

The speed detector is a simple program that takes the speed of a car as input and calculates the amount of demerit points a 
driver accumulates for driving past the specified speed limit. 
It gives the driver information to determine if they are driving within the legal driving speed.

#Features

Takes speed in terms of kilometers per second (km/s)
It calculates the demerit points on account of the speed compared to the speed limit.
It gives them two feedbacks :
          
 1. OK if the speed is within the speed limit.
                            
2. The demerit points passed the speed limit and a message of "license suspended" when the demerit points exceeded 12.

#Usage 

Key in the speed of the car in Km/s when prompted.

You can run the program in any Javascript environment that supports the console.
